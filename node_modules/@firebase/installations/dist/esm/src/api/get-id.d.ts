A handful of native addons require linking to OpenSSL in one way or another. This introduces a small challenge since node will sometimes bundle OpenSSL statically (the default for node >= v0.8.x), or sometimes dynamically link to the system OpenSSL (default for node <= v0.6.x).

Good native addons should account for both scenarios. It's recommended that you use the `binding.gyp` file provided below as a starting-point for any addon that needs to use OpenSSL:

``` python
{
  'variables': {
    # node v0.6.x doesn't give us its build variables,
    # but on Unix it was only possible to use the system OpenSSL library,
    # so default the variable to "true", v0.8.x node and up will overwrite it.
    'node_shared_openssl%': 'true'
  },
  'targets': [
    {
      'target_name': 'binding',
      'sources': [
        'src/binding.cc'
      ],
      'conditions': [
        ['node_shared_openssl=="false"', {
          # so when "node_shared_op
