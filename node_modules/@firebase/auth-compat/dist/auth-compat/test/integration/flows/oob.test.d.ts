Compatibility notes:

- `this.removeEmpty` is now called automatically for all instances. If this is not desired, this may be overridden on a per instance basis.
- The library has been refactored to use some ES6 features. The external APIs should remain the same, but bower projects that directly referenced the repository will now have to point to the [components/jsdiff](https://github.com/components/jsdiff) repository.
