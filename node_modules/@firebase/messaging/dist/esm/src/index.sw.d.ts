WriteStream on the `outfd` and `logfd` config options.)
* Array: If `Array` is specified as one of the types, then the value
  will be parsed as a list of options.  This means that multiple values
  can be specified, and that the value will always be an array.

If a type is an array of values not on this list, then those are
considered valid values.  For instance, in the example above, the
`--bloo` option can only be one of `"big"`, `"medium"`, or `"small"`,
and any other value will be rejected.

When parsing unknown fields, `"true"`, `"false"`, and `"null"` will be
interpreted as their JavaScript equivalents.

You can also mix types and values, or multiple types, in a list.  For
instance `{ blah: [Number, null] }` would allow a value to be set to
either a Number or null.  When types are ordered, this implies a
preference, and the first type that can be used to properly interpret
the value will be used.

To define a new type, add it to `nopt.typeDefs`.  Each item in that
hash is an object with a `type` member and a `validate` method.  The
`type` member is an object
