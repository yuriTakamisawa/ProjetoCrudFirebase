### Synopsis

```bash
npm view [<package-spec>] [<field>[.subfield]...]

aliases: info, show, v
```

### Description

This command shows data about a package and prints it to stdout.

As an example, to view information about the `connect` package from the registry, you would run:

```bash
npm view connect
```

The default version is `"latest"` if unspecified.

Field names can be specified after the package descriptor.
For example, to show the dependencies of the `ronn` package at version
`0.3.5`, you could do the following:

```bash
npm view ronn@0.3.5 dependencies
```

You can view child fields by separating them with a period.
To view the git repository URL for the latest version of `npm`, you would run the following command:

```bash
npm view npm repository.url
```

This makes it easy to view information about a dependency with a bit of
shell scripting. For example, to view all the data about the version of
`opts` that `ronn` depends on, you could write the following:

```bash
npm view opts@$(npm view ronn dependencies.opts)
